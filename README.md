# Python-yt-dlp

This allows users to select their desired resolution, video extension, audio extension, and fps when downloading a video via the command line interface (CLI). 
Usage:
  1. Ensure that you have the [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) and [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation) modules installed. You do so by doing `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  2. As well as the [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) program to merge video/audio files.
  3. Create a `.env` file to store your `download_path` or you can manually add it in.
  4. Run the script.
